This is a test suite developed by [Timendus](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite).

It consists of the following tests:
1. IBM logo
2. Corax89's opcode test (improved version)
3. Flags test
4. Quirks test
5. Keypad test

In the menu, you can press any of the numbers 1 to 5 on the CHIP-8 keypad
to jump to the corresponding test.

Note that on a PC keyboard the keys Q and W generally map to 4 and 5,
not the numeric keys.
