This test allows the user to change the value of the V3 register using the 2 and 8
keys.

When the 5 key is pressed, the delay timer starts counting down from the
value the user placed into the V3 register, and the screen is updated as the
value changes.

To start:     5      start the timer
              2, 8   change the value
